This means that it's now possible to configure Marshaller implementations in embedded mode or on the server, without having to handle the marshalling of Infinispan internal classes. Consequently, it's possible to easily change the marshaller implementation user for user types, in a similar manner to how users of the HotRod client are accustomed."

Instead we now utilise the ProtoStream library to store user types in the language agnostic Protocol Buffers format. The ProtoStream library provides several advantages over jboss-marshalling, most notably it does not make use of reflection and so is more suitable for use in AOT environments such as Quarkus."
