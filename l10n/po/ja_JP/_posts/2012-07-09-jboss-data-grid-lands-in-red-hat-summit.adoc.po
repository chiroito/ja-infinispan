msgid "It's just over a week since http://www.redhat.com/summit/[Red Hat Summit/JBoss World 2012] finished and it was a great pleasure to be part of it. Heiko Rupp and I were speaking about \"Effectively Manage & Monitor Red Hat JBoss Data Grid Nodes\" where we presented http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/[JDG] and http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/operations-network/[JON] at a high level and then we showed a demo of both products interacting with each other. The presentation's slides are now http://rhsummit.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/zamarreno_data_grids.pdf[available for download]."

We had some great conversations where we were able to synch up our roadmap with them to make sure any requirements they had are met in the future."

I hope it was recorded cos it was very impressive stuff."
