msgid "As I mentioned http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/05/implementing-performant-thread-safe.html[recently], I've implemented an uber-cool new asynchronous API for the cache and am dying to show it off/get some feedback on it. Yes, Alpha3 contains the async APIs. Why is this so important? Because it allows you to get the best of both worlds when it comes to synchronous and asynchronous network communications, and harnesses the parallelism and scalability you'd naturally expect from a halfway-decent data grid. And, as far as I know, we're the first distributed cache - open or closed source - to offer such an API."
