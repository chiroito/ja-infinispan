msgid "To many who are familiar with http://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat]'s model of unsupported upstream projects with supported, heavily tested and certified controlled-release \"products\", the announcement of the JBoss Data Grid (JDG) will come as no surprise.  JDG is to http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] what http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux] is to http://fedoraproject.org/[Fedora], or what http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform] (EAP) is to http://www.jboss.org/jbossas[JBoss AS].  Folks considering deploying Infinispan in a mission-critical production environment should consider JDG instead, not only to gain the benefits of a more thorough quality control and certification process but also to allow Red Hat to provide development and production support and consultancy."
