msgid "Hi all, as most of you know Infinispan has supported several protocols (HotRod, Memcached, REST, WebSocket) to expose caches to remote clients."

msgid "Since the release of http://infinispan.blogspot.it/2013/04/infinispan-530alpha1-is-out.html[Infinispan 5.3.0.Alpha1] we now have a proper distribution for these servers based around a stripped-down JBoss AS 7.2.0 server. What you get is robust support for all of the collateral services needed by the servers (JDBC Datasources, Transactions, Security, Logging, etc) and a solid platform for exposing your remote caches. Because the Infinispan Server only contains the essential services required by the server endpoints, it is not a full-fledged JEE application server, i.e. it cannot be used to deploy applications or host other services."
