msgid "Infinispan 5.2 will sport a much needed configuration overhaul which will affect both the programmatic builder API and the declarative XML parsing."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2012-08-31-configuration-overhaul.adoc:25
msgid "As you all know by now, 5.1 introduced a new fluent builder-based API with immutable POJOs for configuring Infinispan's core. This coolness however was not extended to all the extra modules available for Infinispan (and there are quite a few of those), leaving them with a simple untyped key/value properties-based configuration. This was especially visible (and painful) when configuring the cache loaders, some of which have a plethora of parameters and options."

#: upstream/_posts/2012-08-31-configuration-overhaul.adoc:34
msgid "In 5.2 modules become first-class citizens and can provide their own builders and can take care of parsing their own XML for which they can provide a custom schema (for editors/IDE which provide content-assist).  Modules can retrieve information from either the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/global/GlobalConfiguration.html[GlobalConfiguration] or the per-cache http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/Configuration.html[Configuration] objects via the T modules(Class<T> moduleClass) method."
