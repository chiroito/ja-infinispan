msgid "A couple of weeks back I was speaking about Infinispan and Radargun at http://mow2012.dk/[MOW 2012]. Although this conference was originally focused on Oracle products, for a over a year now, Miracle have been expanding into other territories, such as Microsoft and Java middleware.  However, there's still some work to be done in this area in order to make this a must-go conference for Java developers. Max Andersen and Thomas Heute were presenting as well on topics such as: Ceylon, JBoss AS7 and OpenShift."
