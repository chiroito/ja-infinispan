msgid "I'm delighted to announce the release of Infinispan 5.0.0.ALPHA2 that includes the very first version of http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15622[Infinispan's Distributed Executor Framework]. Make sure you have a look at the javadocs for the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/package-summary.html[distributed executor package] and the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/package-summary.html[map/reduce package].

msgid "On top of this, http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198[the mechanism to plug user-defined externalizers] has changed for ALPHA2 based on invaluable feedback from the community, making it easier for third party applications to abstract Infinispan's Externalizer framework and hide it from end users. From ALPHA2 onwards, Infinispan Lucene directory provides its own http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/Externalizer.html[Externalizer] implementations and so expect a performance improvement in the RPC calls it mades."
