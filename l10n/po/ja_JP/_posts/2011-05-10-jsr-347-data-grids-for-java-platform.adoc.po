msgid "Exciting times; today the JCP voted in a new JSR that I have proposed, http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=347[JSR 347: Data Grids for the Java platform].    I http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/04/following-up-on-my-previous-response-to.html[blogged about the original JSR proposal], and posted a http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/04/in-response-to-pcworld.html[follow-up] to some criticisms around the proposal some weeks ago.  The proposal, however, went ahead, was assigned a number (347!) and has just been voted in by the JCP http://www.jcp.org/en/participation/committee[executive committee]."
