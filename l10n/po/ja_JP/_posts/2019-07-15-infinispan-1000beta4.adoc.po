msgid "Since 5.3, our server has been built on top of WildFly (JBoss AS7 at the time). WildFly gave us a very solid base, including integration with a lot of useful components (security, datasources, management etc) but it also forced us to maintain a large amount of integration code. We have therefore decided to start from a much leaner base to build the new server which, internally we've been calling ServerNG, but which we're now releasing as \"Infinispan Server\". The old WildFly-based server is still available, but it should be considered \"legacy\" and will no longer receive any feature enhancements."
