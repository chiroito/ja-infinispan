msgid "A brand new, experimental, https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6e32d6d53d3096bdcabef4a1cb97c70fbe7d15c3/commons/src/main/java/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.java[FunctionalMap] API has been added that takes advantage of the lambda and async programming improvements introduced in Java 8. We consider this an advanced API that will enable Infinispan to grow beyond the well known javax.cache.Cache and java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap APIs. In the next few days I'll be posting mutiple, detailed, blog posts looking at the different aspects of the API. If you area eager to get started, you can first have a look at https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6e32d6d53d3096bdcabef4a1cb97c70fbe7d15c3/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/functional/decorators/FunctionalConcurrentMap.java[a ConcurrentMap implementation using FunctionalMap] to get a feel for it.  Your feedback is highly appreciated!"
