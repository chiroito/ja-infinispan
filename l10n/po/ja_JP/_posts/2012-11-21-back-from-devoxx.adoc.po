msgid "This year - as always - Devoxx was a great conference! Not only the quality of the presentation (including quite some delivered by my fellows from Red Hat)  but also the chance to meet and discuss with industry experts. And the http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/hackergarten_devoxx_2012[Hackergarten] was one of the this great networking places.  We had a long chat with https://twitter.com/MariusBogoevici[Marius Bogoevici] on a nice extension of the http://www.jboss.org/jdf/examples/ticket-monster/tutorial/Introduction/[Ticket Monster] Tutorial for Infinispan, so that users looking for an sample integration application would have a good starting point. Also http://duncandoyle.blogspot.co.uk/[Duncan Doyle ] contributed a nice demo of the cross-site replication functionality added in Infinispan 5.2 and https://github.com/gscheibel[Guillaume Scheibel] implemented a http://www.mongodb.org/[Mongo DB] cache https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/pull/1473[store extension]: awesome stuff! All in all great conference and very good chance for us to get in touch with our community! Cheers, Mircea"
