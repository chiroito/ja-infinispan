msgid "Rather than releasing a CR1 so soon, I have decided to cut another beta instead, mainly due to the sheer volume of changes since the last beta.  So here is what you have to look forward to. A pile of bugs fixed thanks to reports made by you, the community. A couple of packages upgraded, including JGroups (to 2.8.0.CR2) and JBoss Marshalling (to 1.2.0.CR4).  And two new modules introduced: a tech preview of the http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/09/infinispan-query-breaks-into-400cr1_23.html[query API], and the new http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-infinispan-rest-server.html[RESTful server module], thanks to Navin and Michael accordingly. A full list of issues addressed in this release is available on https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12314028&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA]."
