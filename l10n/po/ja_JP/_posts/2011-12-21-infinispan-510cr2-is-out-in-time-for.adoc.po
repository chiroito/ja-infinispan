From a Infinispan user perspective, there's been some changes to how Infinispan is extended, in particular related to https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/OQFT[custom command implementations], where we know use http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[JDK's ServiceLoader] to load them."
