msgid "The main driver behind this is that we've finally managed to get our hands on a sizeable cluster large enough to truly test scalability.  Expect interesting public benchmarks to be published soon, watch this space. (I recently http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/02/infinispan-as-local-cache.html[blogged about some local-mode benchmarks])"

msgid "To enable such benchmarks, we've renewed efforts on building out the http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cachebenchfwk/wiki[Cache Benchmarking Framework]. This framework was originally a part of JBoss Cache's http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosscache/benchmarks/benchmark-fwk/trunk/[source tree], and has now been extracted and migrated to SourceForge. We welcome others contributing additional plugins for more distributed cache/data grid products, as well as more tests and access patterns."
