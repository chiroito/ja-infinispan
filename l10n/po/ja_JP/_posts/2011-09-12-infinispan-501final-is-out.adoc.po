msgid "Thanks to everyone that downloaded Infinispan 5.0.0.FINAL in the last month. We've had tremendous feedback and as a result of that we've just released Infinispan 5.0.1.FINAL to address some of the most important issues reported. These issues are primarily around https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/-4B7[distribution clustering mode] and rehashing. So, if you're using any of these features, I'd strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible."
