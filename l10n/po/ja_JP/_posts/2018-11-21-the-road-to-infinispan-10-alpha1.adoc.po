"which will supersede the current WildFly-based offering. The new server\n"
"will have a smaller disk and memory footprint, a new RESTful admin\n"
"interface, improved security. It will still use familiar components\n"
"(Elytron for security, Narayana for transactions, etc) but we hope that\n"
"the installation and usability experience will be most improved. A\n"
"dedicated blog post will describe in detail what is coming.\n"
