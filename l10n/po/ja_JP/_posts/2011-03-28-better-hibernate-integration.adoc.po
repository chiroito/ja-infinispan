msgid "Starting with 5.0 Infinispan's transaction support was https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-888?focusedCommentId=12592115#comment-12592115[enhanced] to allow Synchronization-based enlistment in transactions (v.s.  XAResource). A main use case for this is Hibernate's second level cache: by using Synchronization the transaction manager doesn't have to write the log on the disk. On the short, better performance!"
