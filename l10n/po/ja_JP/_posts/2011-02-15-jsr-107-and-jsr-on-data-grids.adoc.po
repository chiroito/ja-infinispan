msgid "My feel is JSR-107 needs to be axed.  It's been inactive for way too long, it is out of date, and the community is pretty jaded about it.  We do, however, need a JSR around _distributed_ caches and in-memory data grids.  There is definitely a need in the Java EE 7 umbrella specification, particularly with increasing focus and alignment with cloud.  Apps designed to scale would almost certainly need a distributed, in-memory data grid.  If Java EE is to be the preferred platform to build Software-as-a-Service offerings, scalability is crucial."
