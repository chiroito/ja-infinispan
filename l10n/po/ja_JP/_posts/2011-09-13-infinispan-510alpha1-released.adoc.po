msgid "Thanks to Israel Lacerra, Infinispan now supports fully distributed queries which allows queries to be parallelised across all nodes.  Creating a distributed query is very easy, simply call http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/query/SearchManager.html#getClusteredQuery(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20java.lang.Class...)[SearchManager.getClusteredQuery].  Please note that this feature is experimental and the API is likely to change before the final release."

msgid "In Infinispan 5.0, we introduced the possibility of executing operations against a cache in such way that class loading could occur with a user-provided classloader. In this new release, we've extended the use case to allow data that's stored in binary format to be unmarshalled with the given classloader. This is particularly handy for those users that are deploying Infinispan in modular, or OSGI-like environments. For more information, check http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#with(java.lang.ClassLoader)[AdvancedCache.with(ClassLoader)  API]."
