msgid "For end users, the biggest change is a further refinement of the fluent API first introduced in ALPHA3. We've basically worked hard to make it even more fluent and make it easier to quickly read and write programmatic configuration. The end result can be found in this example https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/5.0.0.ALPHA4/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/config/ProgrammaticConfigurationTest.java[test file]. Note that this changes are not compatible with 5.0.0.ALPHA3 fluent API."

msgid "For those service providers who are extending Infinispan to provide their own functionality, you can know extend Infinispan so that your own commands can be sent to other Infinispan nodes. This helps solve problems such as http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3818[HHH-3818] in more elegant way without needing to rely on listeners and special types of objects. You can find examples of how to extend Infinispan to build your own commands https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-sample-module[here], and please note that as with any SPI, it requires a high understand of the code involved, so use it with care."
