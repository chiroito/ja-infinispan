msgid "I've just released Infinispan 4.1.0.CR2, codenamed _Radegast_.  Why is this release so important?  Because it is very close to the final version of the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] wire protocol, and the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15356[client] and http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[server] modules that sit on either end of Hot Rod, allowing remote and non-JVM access to the data grid.  Further, the memached protocol - along with the ability to make use of any existing memcached client - is also supported."
