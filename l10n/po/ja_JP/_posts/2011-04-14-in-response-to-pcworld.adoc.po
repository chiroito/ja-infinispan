msgid "I don't quite understand what is meant by Red Hat's approach not being the best solution.  Do people take issue with having a standard in the first place?  Or is it the standards body used in this particular case (the JCP)?  If it is the details of the standard itself, one should keep in mind that this has _yet to be defined_ by an expert group!"

msgid "The importance of a standard, to remove vendor lock-in, etc., is pretty well understood, so I won't go into too much detail here.  But with that in mind, I find Pandey's comment regarding a _\"self-beneficial move\"_ an odd one.  A standard makes it easier for people to switch between products (which may explain why no one else may have stepped up to the plate to propose such a standard thus far).  Proposing a standard makes it easier for end-users to _move away_ from Infinispan.  Yes, it may help with awareness of Infinispan, but it also means Red Hat, just like other data grid vendors, will need to work _really hard_ to make sure their products are up to scratch.  The only real beneficiary here is the end-user.  In fact, I'd like to invite Terracotta to participate in this JSR, as participation can only make it stronger, more relevant and eventually even more useful to end-users."

msgid "With regards to JSR-107, I believe Pandey has misunderstood the intention in proposing a data grid JSR.  I have proposed extending and building _on top of_ JSR-107 - not throwing it away - and I have expressed this the JSR-107 expert group mailing list, of which Terracotta's Greg Luck is a member.  In fact, without Pandey's actually seeing my http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/04/following-up-on-my-previous-response-to.html[data grid proposal blog post] - PCWorld's article was written _before_ I published details of the JSR submission, based on a high-level Red Hat http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2011/Red-Hat-Drives-Leadership-in-Java-EE-Innovation[press release] - one has to wonder where such strong words come from!  :-)"
