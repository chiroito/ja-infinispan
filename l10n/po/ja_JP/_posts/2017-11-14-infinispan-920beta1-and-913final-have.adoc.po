It's now possible to manage your counters via JMX [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7926[ISPN-7926]] and other management methods are on the way.

If you used _compare-and-set_, the _compare-and-swap_ may improve your code performance. And last but not least, a new _sync()_ method was added to the strong and weak counters, useful if you don't want to handle the CompletableFuture! https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8379[]"
