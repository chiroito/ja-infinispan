msgid "Firstly, what is EDG?  It is a data grid platform, based on the open source http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] project (and hence the relevance on this blog).  Just as Red Hat only offers support and subscriptions for http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application/[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform] (EAP) and not the community http://www.jboss.org/jbossas[JBoss Application Server] (AS) for its Java EE server offering, Red Hat will only offer support and subscriptions for EDG and not the community project, Infinispan."
