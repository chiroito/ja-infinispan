msgid "Good news everyone - Infinispan 5.3.0 will be introducing a https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-31[long awaited] JPA cache store.   This cache store will allow you to store cache entries in the database using proper schema - so that other applications can read the persisted data as well."

msgid "In normal use cases, it's recommended to leverage Infinispan as JPA second level cache and/or query cache. However, if you'd like to use only Infinispan API and you want Infinispan to read from database, or to persist the data into a database with well defined schema, then JPA cache store could be right for you."

msgid "Prior to JPA cache store, those who wants to use Infinispan in front of a database to read/write database records would need to write their own cache store implementation.  Now, with JPA cache store, users can use Infinispan in front of a database (write-through or write-behind) with ease by using standard JPA mapping and configurations."
