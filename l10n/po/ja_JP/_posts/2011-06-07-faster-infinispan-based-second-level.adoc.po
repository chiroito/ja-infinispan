msgid "Starting with Hibernate 4.0.0.Beta1, Infinispan second level cache interacts with the transaction manager as a JTA Synchronization instead of an XA resource. Based on some testing we've done in JBoss AS 7, this has resulted in a huge performance increase http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanTransactions#Enlisting_Synchronization[thanks to the optimisations the transaction manager can apply] to Synchronizations, which work very well when Infinispan is used as a cache rather than as a authoritative data store."

msgid "From an Infinispan configuration perspective, nothing needs changing.  The Infinispan provider still uses the same https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-core/blob/master/hibernate-infinispan/src/main/resources/org/hibernate/cache/infinispan/builder/infinispan-configs.xml[base configuration] by default. Transactional configuration happens within the cache provider itself and it's here where the Infinispan is configured with Hibernate's transaction manager and where Infinispan is configured to participate as a JTA synchronization. This is the default configuration, so from an user perspective, there's nothing you have to do to take advantage of this new change."
