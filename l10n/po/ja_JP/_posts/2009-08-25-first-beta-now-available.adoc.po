msgid "Beta1 is finally feature-complete. This is also the first release where http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/08/distribution-instead-of-buddy.html[distribution] is complete, with rehashing on joins and leaves implemented as well. In addition, a number of bugs reported on previous alpha releases have been tended to."

msgid "This is a hugely important release for Infinispan. No more features will be added to 4.0.0, and all efforts will now focus on stability, performance and squashing bugs. And for this we need your help! Download, try out, feedback. And you will be rewarded with a rock-solid, lightning-fast final release that you can depend on."
