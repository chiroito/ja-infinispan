msgid "Infinispan 6.0.0.Alpha4 is now with a few very important changes, particularly around cache stores. We've completely revamped the cache store/loader API to align it a bit better with JSR-107 (old CacheStore has become CacheWriter) and to simplify creation of new implementations.  The new https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheLoader.java[CacheLoader] and https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheWriter.java[CacheWriter] should help implementors focus on the important operations and reduce the coding time. We've also created https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.java[AdvancedCacheLoader] and https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.java[AdvancedCacheWriter] in order to separate for bulk operations or purging for those implementations that wish optionally implement them. Expect a blog post from Mircea in the next few days providing many more details on this topic."
