msgid "Firstly last Tuesday, I introduced Infinispan to http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2009/infinispan.html[Switzerland]http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2009/infinispan.html['s Java User Group], where a crowd of around 20 people learned about the usability improvements introduced, the performance and memory consumption enhancements, and forthcoming new features. To finish the presentation, I showed the audience a demo of 3 http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-10278[distributed] Infinispan instances connected to an Amazon S3 cache store via http://www.jclouds.org/[JClouds]. I received some very positive feedback from the attendees who, in particular, were interested in finding out http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-cloudgrid/?ca=dgr-dth-cloudjw22CloudvsGrid&S_TACT=105AGX59&S_CMP=grsitejw22[the differences between grid and cloud computing]."

A lot of Spring developers attended the presentation who were very keen on integrating Infinispan in their own projects."
