msgid "When the HotRod protocol was designed, one of the primary goals was to make it language neutral so that applications written in different languages could interact with the data placed inside an Infinispan Data Grid. The HotRod protocol is special because intelligent clients can offer superior performance by being aware of how data is stored in the grid. We offer three levels of client intelligence:"
