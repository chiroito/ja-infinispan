msgid "Activities grouped under this title are motivated by the change in the development approach of the new features. Until version 7 [#result_box]#we have followed the approach of keeping the baseline compiler requirements quite low to ensure a broad client portability, even to platforms with old compilers/libraries, #[#result_box]#but when we started development for the 8 series we felt that this principle would excessively complicate the implementation of new features.#"
