msgid "If you want to get your feet wet with Infinispan, but you thought the idea a bit daunting, you should worry no longer ! We have developed a very simple application which starts without Infinispan, and, step by step, grows into a fully-fledged distributed application complete with clustered listeners, externalizers and map/reduce. http://infinispan.org/tutorials/embedded/[Check it out] in our new http://infinispan.org/tutorials/[tutorials section]. We will soon be adding more tutorials exploring different aspects of Infinispan."
