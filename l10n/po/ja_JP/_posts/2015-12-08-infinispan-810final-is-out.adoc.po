msgid "This release brings many enhancements but most of all we would like to highlight the new Infinispan Web Management Console which is finally ready for prime time. We have gone through quite a few iterations in UI/UIX design to make sure the majority of use case scenarios are covered. In 8.2 release we are going to add further enhancements to configuring and managing endpoints, server tasks, cache containers and others. Until then, have a look, try it out and do not forget to provide us with your feedback. As a teaser, we provide you with the following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_j3dz4k4xA[video] showcasing the new admin console."
