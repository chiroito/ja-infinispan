msgid "We've just released Infinispan 7.2.0.Beta2 which adds better support for determining which configuration options have been defined by the user versus those options that contain default values. This is an important stepping stone in our aim to enable partial configuration overlays and proper configuration template support."

msgid "Finally, in order to provide better out-of-the-box experience with Near Caches in Java Hot Rod client, we have made mandatory to define the maximum number of entries Near Caches should have. Previously, Near Caches were configured to be unbounded by default which would have resulted in memory leaks unless the client removed them by calling RemoteCache.remove() or similar. A configuration exceptions is reported now if no maximum size has been defined in the Java Hot Rod client, but the user can still provide a 0 or negative value to indicate the Near Caches should be unbounded."
