msgid "First up is http://snowcamp.io/2016/en/[SnowCamp 2016], a conference taking place in Grenoble from 21st to 23rd January. The talk I'm presenting is titled https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/event/5meE/distributed-data-processing-with-infinispan-and-java-streams?iframe=no[\"Distributed Data Processing with Infinispan and Java Streams\"]. Java 8 has made data processing easier than ever and with the help of Infinispan, that data processing can easily be done in a distributed manner. This talk is focused on showing how to use Java Streams to do distributed data processing with Infinispan, and how this approach compares with other data processing APIs Infinispan exposes."
