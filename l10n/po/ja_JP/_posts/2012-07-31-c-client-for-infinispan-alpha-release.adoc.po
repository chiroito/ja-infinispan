msgid "A while ago I was http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/gsoc[announcing] that http://twitter.com/sunimalr[Sunimal Rathnayake] would start the work for a C# Hot Rod  client for Infinispan as part of the http://code.google.com/soc/[Google Summer of Code]. After 2 months of heavy work Sunimal delivered an intelligence-one (basic client, interested in neither cluster nor hash information) implementation.  The release distribution can be downloaded from https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/downloads[here].  Besides the required binaries and doclets, is also contains a sample application showing how the client can be configured and illustrating the basic operations with the server.  This and more are being described in the readme.txt file in the distribution root."
