msgid "For those that don't know: RESTful design is using the well proven and established http/web standards for providing services (as a simple alternative to WS-*) - if that still isn't enough, you can read more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer[here]. So for Infinispan that means that any type of client can place data in the Infinispan grid."

msgid "So what would you use it for? For non java clients, or clients where you need to use HTTP as the transport mechanism for caching/data grid needs. A content delivery network (?) - push data into the grid, let Infinispan spread it around and serve it out via the nearest server. See here for details on using http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/AccessingdatainInfinispanviaRESTfulinterface[http and URLs] with it."

This is at present a war file (tested on JBoss AS and Jetty) which should work in most containers - we plan to deliver a stand alone server (with an embedded JBoss AS) Real Soon Now."
