msgid "Infinispan 7.0.0.Alpha1 makes it possible to easily run the HotRod client in an OSGi based container such as Karaf. Until this point there was no easy way to find out which libraries were required for the HotRod client to run in OSGi. These libraries then had to be installed manually and dynamic imports enabled for all the libraries. Last but not least, it was not possible to use the latest HotRod feature - remote queries."

msgid "There's still one limitation with respect to remote querying, though.  The remote query feauture requires a JMX-based connection to Infinispan server in order to be able to register a .protobin file, which holds the description of data types being transferred between the client and server. Since a remoting-jmx protocol is required and the existing remoting-jmx client does not work correctly in OSGi (see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4011), it is required to register the .protobin file in another way - not from inside the OSGi container.  This will be fixed in one of the next releases."
