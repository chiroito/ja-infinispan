msgid "From an Infinispan perspective, we started the week with a Streaming Data deep-dive session presented together with Clement Escoffier. This was a 3h long session, so there was plenty to go through but we managed to do it on time. The final demo did not fully work, but this is something we will improving it in the near future. Slides can be found in [http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-1[1]]"

msgid "Next day I had a talk on streaming data analysis on top of Kubernetes where I went through some of the topics explained in the deep dive. This was mostly a live coding session showing how to work with streaming data on top OpenShift/Kubernetes which run on Google Cloud. This session was recorded. I'll keep an eye for when the video becomes available to share it here. The code from this session can be found http://bit.ly/sdk8s-code[here], slides http://bit.ly/sdk8s-jfokus18-slides[here] and the live coding instructions http://bit.ly/sdk8s-jfokus18-lc[here]."
