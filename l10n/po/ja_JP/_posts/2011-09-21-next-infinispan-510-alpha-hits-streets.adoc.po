msgid "Infinispan 5.1.0.ALPHA2 _\"Brahma\"_ is out now containing a consolidated push-based approach for both state transfer in replicated caches and rehashing in distributed ones. The new changes don't have great impact on the distributed cache users, but for those that relied on state transfer, it's definitely good news :). State transfer now works in such way that when a node joins, all nodes in the cluster push state to it, rather than the new node getting it from the cluster coordinator. As a result of this, the task of providing the state is paralellized, reducing the load on state providers."
