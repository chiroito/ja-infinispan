More specifically, this post will focus mostly on the reasons behind the change, while the next ones will be of a more practical nature."

msgid "While the server bootstrap code was trivial, it was not going to scale to support all the things we needed (security, management, provisioning, etc). We therefore decided to build our next server on top of the very robust foundation provided by WildFly (aka, the application server previously known as JBoss AS 7), which made its first appearance in 5.3."

msgid "Integration with WildFly's management model was not trivial but it gave us all of the things we were looking for and more, such as deployments, data sources, CLI, console, etc. It also came with a way to provision multiple nodes and manage them from a central controller, i.e. domain mode. All of these facilities however came at the cost of a lot of extra integration code to maintain as well as a larger footprint, both in terms of memory and storage use, caused by a number of subsystems which we had to carry along, even though we didn't use them directly."

msgid "Fast-forward several versions, and the computing landscape has changed considerably: services are containerized, they are provisioned and managed via advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes or via configuration management tools like Ansible and the model we were using was overlapping (if not altogether clashing) with the container model, where global configuration is immutable and managed externally."

msgid "The new server separates global configuration (clustering, endpoints, security) from the configuration of dynamic resources like caches, counters, etc. This means that global configuration can be made immutable while the mutable configuration is stored separately in the global persistence location. In a containerized environment you will place the persistence location onto a volume that will survive restarts."
