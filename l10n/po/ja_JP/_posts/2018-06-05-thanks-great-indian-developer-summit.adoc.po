msgid "A few days after https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/04/danke-javaland-merci-devoxx-france.html[Devoxx France], I headed for http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/[Great Indian Developer Summit] in Bangalore where I spoke about handling streaming data on top of a Kubernetes platform. This was a very similar talk to the one I gave at https://www.jfokus.se/[JFokus] but with some important changes.  Together with Clement we created a small https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2] façade for Infinispan.  When combined with https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rx/java2/[Vert.x RxJava 2 API], we could finally have an idiomatic way of handling streaming data asynchronously and coordinating events purely using RxJava 2 APIs. This is crucial for working with streaming data in an efficient way. On top of that, I made some changes to push the binary data used by the demo outside of the deployment."

msgid "Unfortunately Murphy struck during the presentation and I was unable to run the live coding demo. A problem with Docker size image during preparation combined with a cleanup I ran before the talk meant some of the images had to be re-downloaded. The wireless internet connection at the conference nor the mobile connection were good enough for me to recover it. Once back in the hotel where I had a stable connection I was able to record a screencast of the steps I would have followed during the Great Indian Developer Summit talk. You can find this screencast below:"

We combined past stories of my time at JBoss support with Ray's Kubernetes troubleshooting experience to create an engaging talk :). You can find the video below:"

Both Sebastian and I have been working on a blog series which will be published very soon."
