msgid "Berlin's http://www.jug-bb.de/[Brandenburg JUG] organised an event at the http://www.newthinking-store.de/[NewThinking Store] in Berlin's trendy http://wikitravel.org/en/Berlin/Mitte[Mitte] district. Thanks to Tobias Hartwig and Ralph Bergmann for organising the event, which drew an audience of about 35 people. Cloud computing was the focus of the evening, and I started the event with my rather lengthy presentation on cloud computing and specific issues around persisting data in a cloud.  The bulk of the presentation focused on Infinispan, what it provides as a data grid platform, and what's on the roadmap. After a demo and a short break, Infinispan committer Adrian Cole then spoke about http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/[JClouds], demonstrating Infinispan's use of JClouds to back cached state onto Amazon's S3. You can read more about Adrian's presentation on http://anyweight.blogspot.com/2009/07/double-feature-in-mitte.html[his blog]."

Thanks to Tobias Frech and http://pilhuhn.blogspot.com/[Heiko Rupp] for organising this event, which was held in one of Red Hat's training rooms in Stuttgart. The presentation followed a similar pattern to what was presented in Berlin, to an audience of about 15 people."

The https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-24[JPA interface] which is on our roadmap generated a lot of interest, as did the https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-32[query API] and to a lesser extent the https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-72[asynchronous API]"
