However, to provide consistency we have to listen to remote modification/removal events from the server, which can make work loads with a lot of writes not scale. As such we are introducing bloom filter assisted notifications that will reduce the amount of modification/removal events received from the server and thus would increase the scalability of write heavy applications using the near cache. This needs to be enabled in addition to near caching, which can be done via the client configuration xml or programmatic classes."
