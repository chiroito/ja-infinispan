msgid "http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] and http://seamframework.org/[Seam] are doing it again, and this year http://jboss.org/arquillian[Arquillian] will be there to keep things in check: a community social in the midst of Europe's premier Java conference, http://www.devoxx.com/display/Devoxx2K10/Home[Devoxx] in Antwerp. If you plan to be at Devoxx - or just happen to be nearby - and fancy an evening of in-depth conversation about three open source projects set to rock the enterprise, come on by and partake in some of the finest beer in the world with the project core developers. Demos, design discussions, architectural questions are all fair game. Join our pilgrimage to http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1232/?view=beerfly&ba=tendermorsel[Kulminator] at 20:00 on Monday the 15th of November (near the http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Groenplaats,+Meir+2000+Antwerp,+Flemish+Region,+Belgium&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Groenplaats&ei=19XZTLyrFZDCswb_nIDkBw&ved=0CBUQ8gEwAA&hl=en&cd=2&geocode=FauIDQMdnClDAA&split=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=23.875,57.630033&z=17[Groenplaats] Station)."
