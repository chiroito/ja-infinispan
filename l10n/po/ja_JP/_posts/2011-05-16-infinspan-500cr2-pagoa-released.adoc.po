msgid "In addition to bug fixes, we have a new module - Spring integration, contributed by Olaf Bergner - which allows you to use Infinispan as a backend to http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.M1/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html[Spring 3.1's Cache API] instead of the ConcurrentMap or EHCache implementations shipped with Spring.  You'd just need to include infinispan-spring.jar and configure Spring to use one of the Infinispan providers, https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/spring/src/test/resources/org/infinispan/spring/provider/sample/CachingBookDaoContextTest.xml[as detailed here].  Thanks Olaf!"
