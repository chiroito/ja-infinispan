This will be included from next Hibernate 3.5 release onwards but if you cannot wait and wanna play with it in the mean time, just checkout http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/hibernate/core/trunk/[Hibernate trunk from our SVN repository] and run 'mvn install'."

msgid "On top of that, starting with this cache provider, we're aiming to reduce the number of files needed to modify in order to define the most commonly tweaked parameters. So, for example, by enabling eviction/expiration configuration on a per generic Hibernate data type or particular entity/collection type via hibernate.cfg.xml or persistence.xml, users don't have to touch to Infinispan's cache configuration file any more. You can find detailed information on how to do this in the http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-14105[\"Using Infinispan as JPA/Hibernate Second Level Cache Provider\" wiki]"
