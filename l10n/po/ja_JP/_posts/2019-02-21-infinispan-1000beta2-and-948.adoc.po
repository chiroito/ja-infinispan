msgid "The first change I should outline is one that will impact you if you are building Infinispan from source. The previous build structure required having both JDK 8 and JDK 11 in order to compile a release which worked on both. In order to simplify the build process, as well as ensuring that the output is always consistent we now require Java 11 only. Don't worry: the resulting binaries will still work on Java 8 and greater."
