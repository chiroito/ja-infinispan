msgid "What's new? Galder Zamarre√±o's recent contribution of ripping out the marshalling framework Infinispan \"inherited\" from JBoss Cache and replacing it with JBoss Marshalling has made the marshalling code much leaner, more modular and more testable, and comes with a nifty performance boost too. What's also interesting is that he has overcome issues with object stream caching (see my blog on the subject) by using JBoss Marshalling streams which can be reset. This too provides a very handy performance boost for short lived streams. (See https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-42[ISPN-42], https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-84[ISPN-84])"

msgid "And I've implemented some enhancements to the Future API. Now, rather than returning Futures, the xxxAsync() methods return a NotifyingFuture.  NotifyingFuture extends Future, adding the ability to register a notifier such that the caller can be notified when the Future completes.  Note that Future completion could mean any of successful completion, exception or cancellation, so the listener should check the state of the Future using get() on notification. For example:"
