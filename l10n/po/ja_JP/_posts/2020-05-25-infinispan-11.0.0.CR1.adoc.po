msgid "Taking advantage of vector clocks, in asynchronous mode, Infinispan is able to detect conflicts.  A conflict happens when 2 or more sites update the same key at the same time.  Conflicts are resolved based on the site's names. Updates from the site lexicographically lower, take priority, in case of conflicts.  As an example, if you have 3 sites, LON, NYC and SFO, conflicts between LON and NYC discards updates from NYC and keeps the updates from LON.  You can choose the priority by prepending a number to the site name. For example, if you want updates from NYC to take priority, you can set the site name to “1-NYC”."
