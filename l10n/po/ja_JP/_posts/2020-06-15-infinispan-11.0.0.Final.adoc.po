Additionally, if you are securing the server with https://keycloak.org[Keycloak], accessing the console will correctly obtain credentials through the realm login page."

msgid "Our quest to make better use of the available hardware resources in all deployment models (bare-metal, containerized, virtualized) continues as we've now consolidated a lot of thread-pools into just two: non-blocking and blocking.  Most of the code now makes use of the non-blocking pool. Paths which may block, such as certain persistent stores, use the blocking pool so that they don't hold up work that may be processed without blocking.  This release also includes a new non-blocking Store SPI, so that you can take advantage of stores with real non-blocking I/O."

This means that you can add capacity with zero-impact to your operations. Obviously this comes at the cost of reduced resilience in case of failures, but, for scenarios where high availability is not required, this gives you a highly scalable in-memory storage solution."
