msgid "Last month, at the http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html[JavaOne] conference in San Francisco, I spoke about data grids.  A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)[BOF] session on on cloud-ready data stores using data grids, and a conference session on measuring performance and benchmarking data grids.  But in addition to the official JavaOne talks, I also did two short, 20-minute mini-sessions at the http://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat] booth at the JavaOne pavillion, titled _Data-as-a-Service using Infinispan_.  The good folks at the Red Hat booth even recorded it and put it online on Vimeo, where it is accessible on-demand."
