msgid "The first ever http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/[JUDCon Brazil] was held a couple of weeks back and it was a real blast! Firstly, it offered a great opportunity to meet some members of the JBoss community which have been helping us push JBoss projects forward in this region of the world, such as https://twitter.com/hannelita[Hanneli Tavante], http://www.linkedin.com/in/wrsantos[Roberto dos Santos Wagner], ...etc.  It was great sharing ideas, experiences...etc with them and coming up with new ideas!"

msgid "As mentioned before in the post before the conference, I had two new presentations to deliver, one on JSR-107 specification on JCache API and Infinispan's implementation, and the other on Hibernate Second Level Cache with Infinispan. The JCache presentation went really well and all the live coding worked as expected."
