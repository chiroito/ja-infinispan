You can find out more about the design in https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17571[this article] and I've also started a Infinispan Development mailing list discussion in order to http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev/2012-February/010239.html[open a debate] on this article."

msgid "Remember that remote event handling is the key piece that allows https://www.jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/London2011/day1track2session2.pdf[near-cache like patterns] to be built in Infinispan and we know for a fact that this is one of the most demanded Infinispan patterns. So, if you have an interest in near caches, please provide any feedback you might have on the kind of event subscriptions and notifications you're interested."
