msgid "Don't be scared the name, _use1PcForAutoCommitTransactions_ is a new feature (5.1.CR1) that does quite a cool thing: increases your transactions's performance.  Let me explain.  Before Infinispan 5.1 you could access the cache both transactional and non-transactional. Naturally the non-transactional access is faster and offers less consistency guarantees.But we don't support mixed access in Infinispan 5.1, so what what's to be done when you need the speed of non-transactional access and you are ready to trade some consistency guarantees for it? Well here is where _use1PcForAutoCommitTransactions_ helps you. What is does is forces an induced (_autoCommit=true_) transaction to commit in a single phase. So only 1 RPC instead of 2RPCs as in the case of a full 2 Phase Commit (2PC)."
