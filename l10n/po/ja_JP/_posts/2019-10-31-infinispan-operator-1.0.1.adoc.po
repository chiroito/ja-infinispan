msgid "This is our first blog post about 1.0.x operator series (yeah, sorry 1.0.0 we forgot about you) and as you can notice there's no Alpha, Beta or CR label at the end of the release tag.  This is because OperatorHub and Openshift Catalog only allow numerical version like Maj.Min.Mic and instead of labels we now use the channel to indicate the stability of a release. We have 2 live channels at the moment for the Infinispan operator: `stable` and `dev-preview`. Current `stable` is 0.3.2 which is for the 9.x Infinispan cluster and current `dev-preview` is 1.0.1 which works with 10.x clusters."
