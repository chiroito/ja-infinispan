msgid "Actually, it wasn't as sad as that: they all shared a single parent - the default cache. While this gave caches a limited form of inheritance, it led to confusion as users weren't really aware of it and it was impossible to turn it off: the limited gene pool was propagating possibly unwanted traits to all of its children."

msgid "In the above example, the default cache is a replicated cache with a file store. The distributed cache inherits the _\"transactional\"_ configuration. However, because of default inheritance present up to Infinispan 8.2, the distributed-cache also ended up having a file store.  Confusing or what !?! The best workaround was to never give it a specific configuration, let Infinispan use its internal defaults and essentially avoid it. Just like the black sheep in the family."
