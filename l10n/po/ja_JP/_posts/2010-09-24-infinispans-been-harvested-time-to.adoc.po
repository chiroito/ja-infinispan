I will also be talking about http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#1000AM[the Infinispan Server modules] in this conference. On top of that, Mircea Markus will be explaining http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#100PM[how transactions are handled within Infinispan] and how to do http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#100PM[continuous querying of Infinispan data grids]. In total, Infinispan has 4 talks @ JUDCon which is very exciting for us!!"
