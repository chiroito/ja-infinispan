msgid "POSA follows the same concept as AOSA - a different authoritative figure in the open source community is responsible for each chapter, providing you with excellent insight on how some of the most popular open source applications have been designed and built.  POSA focuses specifically on performance rather than general software architecture, and I've contributed a chapter on the performance related work conducted for Infinispan (see http://aosabook.org/en/posa/infinispan.html[Chapter 7])."
