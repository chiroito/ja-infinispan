msgid "Corporate slaves often spend months of paper work only to find their machine obsolete before its powered on.   Forward thinking individuals need playgrounds to try out new ideas.  Enterprise 2.0 projects have to scale with their user base.  In short, there's a lot of demand for flexible infrastructure.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_infrastructure#Infrastructure[Cloud infrastructure] is one way to fill that order."

msgid "One popular cloud infrastructure provider is http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2].  EC2 is basically a pay-as-you-go datacenter.  You pay for CPU, storage, and network resources.  Using the open-source http://www.jboss.org/infinispan[Infinispan] data grid, you have a good chance of linear performance as your application needs change.  Using EC2, you can instantly bring on hosts to support that need.  Great match, right?  What's next?"

msgid "Assuming your data is important, you will need to persist your Infinispan cluster somewhere.   That said, Amazon charges you for traffic that goes in and out of their network... this could get expensive.  So, the next bit is controlling these costs. "
