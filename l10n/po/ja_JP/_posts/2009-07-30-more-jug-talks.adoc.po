msgid "Krakow was great - and hot: 39 degree weather! (Don't we just love global warming?) Anna Kolodziejczyk at http://proidea.org.pl/[Proidea] (who also organises http://www.jdd.org.pl/[JDD]) organised the event, which attracted an excited and interactive audience of about 40 people.  Dublin, beautiful as always, was a polar opposite in terms of weather: a cloudy, windy and wet day, living up to its reputation. Luan O'Carroll of http://www.dubjug.org/[DUBJUG] organised the event, at the plush http://www.odessaclub.ie/[Odessa Club]. Again, an inquisitive audience of about 35 people attended, with a lot of questions on the future of data storage in clouds. Thomas Diesler of http://jbossosgi.blogspot.com/[JBoss OSGi] fame made a surprise guest appearance too."
