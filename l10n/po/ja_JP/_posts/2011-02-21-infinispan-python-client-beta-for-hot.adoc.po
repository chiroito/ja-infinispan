msgid "So, what's in it? For this first beta release, we've implemented all the operations available in the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod specification] and they've been tested with string inputs. This release does not include code to deal with client intelligence superior to 1, so clients cannot receive notifications of cluster changes nor can they locate data in an intelligent manner by applying consistent hash algorithms to the keys.  These capabilities, plus further examples such as how to integrate with payloads from Google Protocol Buffers will come in next beta releases."

In next releases we'll be creating a wiki with more detailed examples."
