msgid "We've just released our first beta version of Infinispan 5.0 \"Pagoa\".  The main highlight in this release is the introduction of our brand new Map/Reduce API to compliment the existing distributed executor API release in a previous alpha version. We had countless discussions around these APIs and the result can be see in our http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/package-frame.html[javadocs] and this http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15622[wiki] which explains the distributed executor and Map/Reduce framework. Please download the http://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/infinispan/5.0.0.BETA1/[5.0.0.BETA1] distribution and play with it! Your feedback is invaluable at this stage as we start to aim towards CR and Final release."

msgid "In other news, the query API has received a major overhaul and apart from providing a more intuitive and powerful API, it hooks into Hibernate Search new SPI making it easier to maintain. Infinispan users now get access to http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/3.4/reference/en-US/html/search-query.html#d0e5541[Faceting] via Hibernate Search as well. A revision of the Infinispan Querying wiki is on its way, but the javadocs available http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/query/package-summary.html[here] are full pointers to get you going."

msgid "EmbeddedCacheManager has been enhanced with some new methods that allow caches http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#removeCache(java.lang.String)[to be removed] all together. That is, remove the contents of a cache cluster wide and in the persistent store. A couple of other methods to go along with this have been added such as http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#cacheExists(java.lang.String)[cacheExists()] and http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getCache(java.lang.String,%20boolean)[a conditional getCache()] that can inform the user when the cache has been completely been removed the system."
