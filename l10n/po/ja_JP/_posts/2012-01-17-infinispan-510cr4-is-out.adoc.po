msgid "Over the past week we've been busy profiling Infinispan, in particular we've been trying to maximise the performance of Infinispan transactional caches which received a major overhaul int the 5.1 'Brahma' series, and the result is that instead of going final, we've decided to cut another candidate release, Infinispan 5.1.0.CR4 which is now available for download from the http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place]. We're confident that these improvements will be greatly appreciated by Infinispan consumers such as Hibernate second-level-cache and JBoss Application Server 7 HTTP session replication."
