msgid "Since the initial release of Cross-Site Replication, the state transfer between sites was really needed. When a new site is brought online, there was not way to synchronize the data between them. Finally, these days are over and it is possible synchronize geographically replicated sites. How to use is described in http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_state_transfer_between_sites[Infinispan's Manual]."
