msgid "Shortly after the first Hot Rod server implementation was released in 2010, https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-374[ISPN-374] was created requesting cache events to be forwarded back to connected clients. Even though embedded caches have had access to these events since Infinispan's first release, propagating them to remote clients has taken a while, due to the increased complexity involved."

On this first post, we show you how to get started with Hot Rod Remote Events with the most basic of examples:"

The server contains the Hot Rod server with which the client will communicate. Once downloaded, start it up running the following from the root of the server:"

msgid "As you can see from the output, by default events come with the key and the internal data version associated with the current value. The actual value is not shipped back to the client for performance reasons.  Clearly, receiving remote events has a cost, and as the cache size increases and more operations are executed, more events will be generated. To avoid inundating Hot Rod clients, remote events can either be filtered server side, or the event contents can be customised. In the next blog post in this series, we will see this functionality in action."
