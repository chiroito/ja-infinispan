msgid "The first of our development releases of Infinispan 12 is here and it features our upgrade to https://hibernate.org/search/[Hibernate Search 6] which finally allows us to upgrade to https://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene 8.x]. We've had to change a few things in our query implementation to accommodate the latest and greatest and to make the feature simpler to use. As expected, being a development release, there are some rough edges and we'd really love *YOUR* help in making sure that we get everything right for the final release later this year."
