msgid "Pessimistic transactions were added in 5.1 and are the \"rebranding\" of eager transactions from previous Infinispan releases. But besides the re-branding, the code also brought some worth mentioning performance optimisation:"

msgid "a single RPC happens for acquiring lock on a key, disregarding the number of invocations. So if you call _cache.put(k,v)_ in a loop, within the scope of the same transaction, there is only one remote call to the owner of _k_."

msgid "if the key you want to lock/write maps to the local node then no remote locks are acquired. In other words there won't be any RPCs for writing to a key that maps locally. This can be very powerful used in conjunction with the https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/IwY5[KeyAffinityService], as it allows you to control the locality of you keys."

msgid "during the two phase commit (2PC), the prepare phase doesn't perform any RPCs: this optimisation is based on the fact locks are already acquired on each write. This means that then number of RPCs during transactions lifespan is reduced with 1."

msgid "for some writes to the cache (e..g _cache.put(k,v)_) two RPCs were performed: one to acquire the remote lock and one to fetch the previous value. The obvious optimisation in this case was to make a single RPC for both operations - which we do starting with 5.1."
