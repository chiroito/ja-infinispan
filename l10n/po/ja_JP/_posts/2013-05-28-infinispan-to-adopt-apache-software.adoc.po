msgid "Starting with Infinispan 6.0, the project will move from its current http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html[GNU Lesser General Public License] (LGPL) v.2.1 licence to the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License] (AL)  v.2.0.  The switch from the weak copyleft LGPL license to the more permissive AL one is in response to continued requests from the wider open source community who intend to integrate Infinispan into open source projects that aren’t LGPL-friendly.  A more permissive license broadens Infinispan’s community, ecosystem and general appeal."
