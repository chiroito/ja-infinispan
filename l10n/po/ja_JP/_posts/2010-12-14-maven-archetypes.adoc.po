msgid "To help you jump-start a new project using Infinispan, we now have Maven Archetypes you can use.  If you don't know what a Maven Archetype is, you should read http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[this article] which explains archetypes in more detail.  Of course, this assumes that you are using http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as a build tool."

msgid "We've created two separate archetypes for Infinispan.  The first sets you up with a clean, new directory structure and sample code for a new Infinispan project, including sample configuration files and skeleton code, as well as a Maven pom.xml descriptor containing all necessary dependencies."

msgid "The second archetype is targeted towards people using Infinispan and want to report bugs and contribute tests to the project.  It sets up a new project with a skeleton functional test, including all of Infinispan's test helper utilities to simulate network setup and failure from within a test.  More important, the generated skeleton test is structured such that it can easily be assimilated into Infinispan's core test suite if necessary."
