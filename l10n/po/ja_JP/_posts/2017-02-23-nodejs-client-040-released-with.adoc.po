msgid "Thanks to the encryption integration, Node.js Hot Rod clients can talk to Hot Rod servers via an encrypted channel, allowing trusted client and/or authenticated clients to connect. Check the https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/tree/v0.4.0#encryption[documentation] for information on how to enable encryption in Node.js Hot Rod client."

msgid "Also, we've added the possibility for the client to connect to multiple clusters. Normally, the client is connected to a single cluster, but if all nodes fail to respond, the client can failover to a different cluster, as long as one or more initial addresses have been provided. On top of that, clients can manually switch clusters using switchToCluster and switchToDefaultCluster APIs. Check https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/tree/v0.4.0#working-with-sites[documentation] for more info."
