msgid "Initial implementation of virtual nodes for consistent hash algorithm based distribution is included. This means that each Infinispan node can now pick multiple nodes in the hash wheel reducing the standard deviation and so improving the distribution of data. The configuration is done via the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/config/FluentConfiguration.HashConfig.html#numVirtualNodes(java.lang.Integer)[numVirtualNodes] attribute in _http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/config.html#ce_clustering_hash[hash]_ element."

msgid "The externalizer configuration has been revamped in order to make it more user-friendly! You only need the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/SerializeWith.html[@SerializeWith] annotation and an http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/Externalizer.html[Externalizer] implementation in its most basic form, but more advanced externalizer configuration is still available for particular use cases. The wiki on plugging externalizers has been rewritten to show http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198[these changes]."

The previous programmatic configuration for this option has been deprecated to help ease migration but your XML will need changing."
