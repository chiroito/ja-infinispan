msgid "For this first beta release, the transaction layer has been redesigned as explained by Mircea in http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/10/transaction-remake-in-infinispan-51.html[this blog post]. This is a very important step in the process of implementing some key locking improvements, so we're very excited about this! Thanks Mircea :)"

msgid "Another interesting little improvement is available for JDBC cache store users. Basically, database tables can now be discovered within an implicit schema. So, if each user has a different schema, the tables will be created within their own space. This makes it easier to manage environments where the JDBC cache store is used by multiple caches at the same time because management is limited to adding a user per application, as opposed to adding a user plus prefixing table names.  Thanks to Nicolas Filotto for bringing this up."
