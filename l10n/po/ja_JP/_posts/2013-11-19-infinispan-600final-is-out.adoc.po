msgid "Support for http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/embedded-and-remote-query-in-infinispan.html[remote query]. It is now possible for the HotRod clients to query an Infinispan grid using a new expressive query DSL. This querying functionality is built on top of Apache Lucene and Google Protobuf and lays the foundation for storing information and querying an Infinispan server in a language neutral manner. The Java HotRod client has already been enhanced to support this, the soon-to-be announced C++ HotRod client will also contain this functionality (initially for write/read, then full blown querying)."

This is a fully fledged HotRod client that is topology (level 2) and consistent hash aware (level 3)  and will be released in the following days. Some features (such as Remote Query and SSL support) will be developed during the next iteration so that it maintains feature parity with its Java counterpart."

We’ve revisited the entire cache loader API and we’re quite pleased with the result: the new http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/new-persistence-api-in-infinispan.html[Persistence API] brought by Infinispan 6.0 supports parallel iteration of the stored entries, reduces the overall serialization overhead and also is aligned with the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107] specification, which makes implementations more portable."

This file store is built with efficiency in mind: it outperforms the existing file store with up to 2 levels of magnitude. This comes at a cost though, as keys need to be kept  in memory.
