msgid "We've just released Infinispan 4.1.0.Alpha2 with even more new functionality for the community to play with. Over the past few weeks we've been going backwards and forwards in the http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev[Infinispan development list] discussing Infinispan's binary client server protocol called http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] and in 4.1.0.Alpha2 we're proud to present the first versions of the Hot Rod server and java client implementations. Please visit http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[this wiki] to find out how to use Hot Rod's java client client and server. Please note that certain functionality such as clients receiving topology and hashing information has not yet been implemented."

msgid "Another cool feature added in this release is GridFileSystem: a new, experimental API that exposes an Infinispan-backed data grid as a file system. Specifically, the API works as an extension to the JDK's File, InputStream and OutputStream classes. You can read more on GridFileSystem http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GridFileSystem[here]."
