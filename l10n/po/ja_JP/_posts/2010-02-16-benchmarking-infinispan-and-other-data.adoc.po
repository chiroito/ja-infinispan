msgid "Why benchmarking? Benchmarking is an important aspect for us: we want to monitor our performance improvements between releases and compare ourselves with other products as well. Benchmarking a data grid product such as Infinispan is not a trivial task: one needs to start multiple processes over multiple machines, coordinate between them to make sure everything runs at once and centralize reports. Then there is the question of what access patterns the benchmark should stress."

This is crucial, since it means educated decisions can be made based on _relevant_ and _use-case specific_ statistics and measurements. Further, the benchmark can even be used to compare performance of different configurations and tuning parameters of a single data grid product, to help users choose a configuration that works best for them"
