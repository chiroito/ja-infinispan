msgid "Thanks to everyone that downloaded Infinispan 5.1.0.FINAL 'Brahma' in the last week. We've had tremendous feedback from the community and as a result we've decided to do a minor release called 5.1.1.CR1 to https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318959[address the most important issues reported]. So, if you're using 5.1.0.FINAL, I'd strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible. We hope to do a FINAL release later on this week."
