msgid "Infinispan has quite a few spectacular ways of executing code in the grid. But I bet you haven't heard or aren't really familiar with those, which is disappointing. I hope to fix this, however, as we have added more information to the user guide and wanted to detail that here in this blog."

msgid "As I am sure you are aware Infinispan can be used in embedded (in your JVM) and remote (in a standalone server). Unfortunately, this means there are different ways of executing code based on which mode you are in."

If you are curious about this one, you should check out the http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#examples_2[Examples] section with the example named \"*Remove specific entries\"* as it details how a user would do exactly that."

With Cluster Executor and Distributed Streams there is a clearer distinction between executing code on nodes (Cluster Executor) and executing code based on data (Distributed Streams).  **"

It can be found in this http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#executing_code_in_the_remote_grid[section].  The benefit of the server is most of these can invoke embedded operations internally."
