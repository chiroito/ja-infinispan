msgid "The trip started in Coimbra where Sanne Grinovero and I http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/04/infinispan-and-ogm-at-ptjug.html[discussed about Infinispan and OGM] at the Portugal JUG. The interest was obvious from the amount of questions and the discussions that followed and ended up late in the night. A big thanks to http://www.samaxes.com/[Samuel Santos] for organising this!"

msgid "Total Order Broadcast (TOB) - is a transaction protocol for replicated caches built on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast[atomic broadcast]. It relies on http://www.jgroups.org/[JGroups']  http://www.jgroups.org/javadoc-3.x/org/jgroups/protocols/SEQUENCER.html[SEQUENCER] protocol for achieving total order. The benchmarks ran comparing it with the current 2PC based transaction protocol are rather promising and we hope to integrated it in our 5.2 release"
