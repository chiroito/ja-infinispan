msgid "One if the big drawbacks in the ConcurrentHashMap, since it was introduced in Java 5, has always been memory footprint.  It is kinda bulky, especially when compared to a regular HashMap - 1.6 kb in memory versus about 100 _bytes_!  Yes, these are for _empty_ maps."

msgid "In Java 8, one of the improvements in the ConcurrentHashMap has been memory footprint - now closer to a regular HashMap.  In addition to that, the new Java 8 CHM performs better under concurrent load when compared to its original form.  See http://concurrency.markmail.org/message/kbqxdfapp5n6u7j3?q=JDK8+CHM[this discussion] and http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8.java?revision=1.37&view=markup[comments] in the proposed ConcurrentHashMapV8 sources for more details."

msgid "So, http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/[Infinispan] makes pretty heavy use of ConcurrentHashMaps internally.  One change in the recently released http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/03/infinispan-512final-is-available-now.html[Infinispan 5.1.2.Final] is these internal CHMs are built using a factory, and we've included a version of the Java 8 CHM in Infinispan.  So by default, Infinispan uses the JDK's provided CHM.  But if you wish to force Infinispan to use the backported Java 8 CHM, all you need to do is include the following JVM parameter when you start Infinispan:"
